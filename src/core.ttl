  `Data Space` is a founding concept of this ontology and is described as an abstraction that comprises:
  
  - Bundle of rights & rules that regulates interactions between data, algorithms, infrastructure and every resources shared by participants.
  - Governance mechanisms to adapt these rules.

A Data Space is highly customizable to allow its members to create a space of sharing designed exactly as they need.

  `Dataset` denotes the collection of related sets of information, encoded in a defined structure, as published by the data provider.
  This includes a wide variety of formats, for example: csv files, images, videos, databases, etc.

  Datasets are accessible on the network by a [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) which defines the means
  (the protocol, e.g. [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)) of access to the resource.

  Datasets are described by a set of descriptions (aka metadata) providing information about one or more aspects of the dataset, like the
  time and date of creation, the file size or the data quality, using specific data description vocabularies and thesaurus (e.g. `Exif`, `EBUCore`, ISO 19115),
  allowing a great extensibility.
