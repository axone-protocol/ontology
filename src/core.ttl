  Zone constitutes a conceptual structure delineated by a predetermined set of regulations. Within this structure, recognized Resources are required to align with the stipulated rules.

  The defining properties and qualities of a Zone are articulated through Verifiable Claims. These Claims play a pivotal role in establishing trust, ensuring extensibility, and promoting adaptability, thereby imparting a comprehensive understanding of a Zone. A particular Verifiable Credential is designated to articulate the governance model of the Zone, encompassing the relevant consents and the economic frameworks governing value exchanges within the Zone. Additionally, other Claims may be employed to cater to specific scenarios, industry segments, collaborative networks, or geographical areas, thus enabling governance models to be customized for specific contexts.

  It is imperative that the RDF identifier assumes the form of a Decentralized Identifier (DID). This specification elevates the RDF resource to the status of a Subject within the realm of Verifiable Claims. The adoption of a DID as the RDF identifier solidifies the resourceâ€™s position in the decentralized identity landscape, ensuring a secure and verifiable identification mechanism.
