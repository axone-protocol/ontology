  rdfs:label "OKP4 Ontology"@en ;
  dcterms:description """
  A vocabulary to describe knowledge graphs within data spaces.

  This ontology is intended to model a semantic network of all the entities (datasets, services, actors...) of a data space by semantically characterizing
  what they are and the relationships they maintain between them.

  The primary objective of the ontology is to provide a complete living understanding and knowledge of the datasets within a data space,
  their transformation (by the services), as well as the governance rules that apply (data sharing, consents, policy rules).  It also describes the
  [Chain of Custody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody) providing the Data Lineage (allowing the traceability) of each piece of data in the data spaces during the
  different processings.
