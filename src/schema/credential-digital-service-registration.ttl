  Digital Service Registration credentials serve as a testament to the existence of a Digital Service within the dataverse.
  
  A Digital Service represents an entity that facilitates access to, manipulation of, and management of Digital Resources. These services are distinguished by their capability to interact with Digital Resources, offering a network interface for users to engage with these resources.

  The URI that identifies and locates the Digital Service.
  
  The URI serves a dual purpose:
  1. **Identification**: It provides a unique identifier for the Digital Service, ensuring that each service can be distinctly recognized within the dataverse.
  2. **Endpoint**: The URI acts as the access point or endpoint for the Digital Service. It specifies where the Digital Service can be accessed and how interactions with the service should be initiated.
