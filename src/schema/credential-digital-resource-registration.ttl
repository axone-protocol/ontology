  Digital Resource credentials serve as a testament to the existence of a Digital Resource within the dataverse.
  
  Digital Resource designates a diverse range of data and information assets, including but not limited to spreadsheets, databases, text, videos, and similar elements. This concept is inherently flexible, adapting continuously to emerging digital formats and technological developments.

  Digital Resources are accessed through Digital Services, which function as channels for the distribution and exchange of these resources across assorted networks. These services take various forms, including network communication protocols like RESTful APIs and gRPC services. The primary role of Digital Services is to aid in the discovery, acquisition, and engagement with Digital Resources. They are pivotal in linking the resources with Orchestrator Services that utilize these resources for diverse applications.
