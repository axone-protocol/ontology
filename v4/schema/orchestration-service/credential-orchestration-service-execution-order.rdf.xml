  The Orchestration Execution Order Credential is a formal declaration that requests the execution of an orchestration, outlining specific parameters for its operation.

  In these credentials, the subject is the Orchestration Service to be executed. The issuer, acting as the principal, is the party who benefits from the execution of the service.

  These credentials function as directives for orchestrating service execution, ranging from simple data processing to complex Machine Learning workflows. They establish a standardized method for requesting and managing service execution in a decentralized and interoperable manner.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">
  A single parameter specifying a part of how the Orchestration Service should be executed, represented as a key-value object. Multiple `withParameter` properties can be used to represent multiple parameters.

  Parameters can be used to specify the input data, the output data, the computational resources, the execution environment, and other aspects of the service execution. The comprehension of the parameters is dependent on the Orchestration Service being targeted.
