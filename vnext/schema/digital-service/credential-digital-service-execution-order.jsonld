The issuer, acting as the principal, is the party who benefits from the execution of the service.\n\n  These credentials function as directives for orchestrating service execution, ranging from simple data processing to complex Machine Learning workflows. They establish a standardized method for requesting and managing service execution in a decentralized and interoperable manner.\n  "
