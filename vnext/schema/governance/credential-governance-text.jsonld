This enables users to more readily engage with the governance text, allowing them to gain a better understanding of how the text operates and the rules governing the relationship between all resources in a Zone within the Dataverse.\n\n  Governance Text is distinct from the Governance itself expressed using logic language (e.g. [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog)), but helps to understand the Governance by providing important context.\n  "

Such Governances are categorized into three main types as recognized by the [OKP4 protocol](https://okp4.network):\n\n  - Zone Rules: Rules establish the boundaries of a specific area in the Dataverse, termed a Zone, within which governance is enforced. Each Zone is governed by its unique set of Rules tailored to its particular function or purpose.\n  - Resource Consent: Consents are agreements associated with the use of Resources within Zones. By resources, we mean Digital Resources (e.g. datasets) or Digital Services. It goes beyond simple approval and encompasses the permissions and restrictions on resource owners' access, usage, sharing, management and handling of their resources. It allows parties to define boundaries and establish terms for others to interact with their digital resources. It's a crucial aspect of governance, ensuring resources are used appropriately per the relevant parties' expressed will and intentions.\n  - Agreement: An agreement between parties involves creating shared understanding, consent, and alignment regarding future actions or outcomes. It signifies that the involved parties voluntarily accept and adhere to the rules, obligations, and conditions outlined in the agreement. By doing so, they demonstrate their commitment to collaboration and willingness to respect the rights and responsibilities defined in the contract until its completion.\n  "
