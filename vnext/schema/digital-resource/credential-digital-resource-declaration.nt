They encompass data and information presented in various forms and expressed, carried, and stored in any format. This includes, but is not limited to spreadsheets, CSV files, databases, text documents, multimedia files such as videos, AI related files like neural network models, and various other digital elements.\n  \n  This concept is inherently flexible, adapting continuously to emerging digital formats and technological developments.\n  "@en .

These services take various forms, including network communication protocols like RESTful APIs and gRPC services. They are pivotal in linking the resources with Orchestrator Services that utilize these resources for diverse applications.\n  \n  For instance, a Digital Resource may be a dataset that is accessed through a RESTful API, and is used by an Orchestrator Service to train a machine learning model.\n  "@en .
