This includes, but is not limited to spreadsheets, CSV files, databases, text documents, multimedia files such as videos, AI related files like neural network models, and various other digital elements.\n  \n  This concept is inherently flexible, adapting continuously to emerging digital formats and technological developments.\n  "
