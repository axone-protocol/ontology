In this context, digital services act as conduits for distributing \n  and exchanging digital resources across various networks. These services manifest in multiple forms, including network communication \n  protocols such as RESTful APIs and gRPC services. They play a crucial role in connecting resources to orchestrator services, which \n  leverage these resources for a range of applications. For instance, a digital resource might be a dataset accessible via a RESTful API,\n  utilized by an orchestrator service to train a machine learning model.\n  "@en .
