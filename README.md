## Ontology construction process

The construction of this ontology follows a number of steps which are described below:

1. __Ontology capture__:
   Identification and definition of key concepts and relationships in the domain of interest and the terms that refer to such concepts, in natural language.
2. __Ontology design__:
   Formalizing of the elements identified in the previous step in the form of a knowledge representation, using the building blocks of ontologies: classes, attributes, relationships, subsumption.  
3. __Ontology encoding__:
   Encoding in [OWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/).
4. __Ontology integration__:
   Association of key concepts and terms in the ontology with concepts and terms of other ontologies.
